## Project Overview

This application provides a web interface for real-time depth map visualization. It uses a webcam to capture video frames, processes them using depth estimation models, and displays the resulting depth map alongside the original video feed.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam
- Two depth estimation models to choose from:
  - Depth-Anything-V2
  - MiDaS (DPT-BEiT-Base-384)
- Interactive web interface for model selection and streaming control
- Real-time depth map visualization

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI: For creating the web server and WebSocket endpoints
  - OpenCV (cv2): For image processing
  - PyTorch: For running the depth estimation models
  - NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays
  - Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
  - WebSocket API

- **Models**:
  - Depth-Anything-V2
  - MiDaS (DPT-BEiT-Base-384)

- **Utilities**:
  - Requests: For downloading model checkpoints
  - tqdm: For progress bars during downloads

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repositories:
   ```bash
   git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2
   cd Depth-Anything-V2
   git clone https://github.com/ChinmayK0607/Assignment-AC.git
   ```

2. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Depth-Anything-V2/requirements.txt
   pip install -r Assignment-AC/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model checkpoints:
   ```bash
   python utils/checkpoint_downloader.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. Allow access to your webcam when prompted

4. Use the interface to select a model and start/stop the depth map streaming

## Methodology

1. **Video Capture**: The application captures video frames from the user's webcam using the browser's MediaDevices API.

2. **Frame Processing**: Captured frames are sent to the backend server via WebSocket.

3. **Depth Estimation**: The backend processes each frame using the selected depth estimation model (Depth-Anything-V2 or MiDaS).

4. **Visualization**: The resulting depth map is colorized and sent back to the frontend for display.

5. **Real-time Streaming**: This process repeats for each frame, creating a real-time depth map stream.

## Models Used

1. **Depth-Anything-V2**: A state-of-the-art depth estimation model that can generate high-quality depth maps for various scenes.

2. **MiDaS (DPT-BEiT-Base-384)**: A robust depth estimation model known for its performance across different datasets and scene types.

## Assessment Criteria Addressed

1. **Code Quality and Organization**: The project is well-structured with separate modules for different functionalities. The code follows PEP 8 guidelines and includes comments for clarity.

2. **Functionality**: The application successfully implements real-time depth map streaming with two different models, meeting the core requirements.

3. **User Interface**: A simple yet functional web interface is provided, allowing users to control the streaming and select models.

4. **Performance**: Asynchronous programming and WebSocket communication are used to ensure smooth real-time performance.

5. **Error Handling**: The application includes error logging and display mechanisms for both frontend and backend issues.

6. **Documentation**: This README provides comprehensive documentation on setup, usage, and the overall methodology.

7. **Innovation**: The project combines cutting-edge depth estimation models with real-time web streaming, showcasing an innovative approach to depth visualization.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more depth estimation models for comparison
- Add options for adjusting video quality and processing speed
- Introduce depth map post-processing for enhanced visualization
- Develop features for recording and saving depth map videos
